              To survive and thrive in New World, you will need to overcome many challenges, learning new skills and
              abilities as you adventure forward. Characters progress across three major categories: Core Attributes,
              Trade Skills, and Weapon Mastery. While you are free to master as many or as few weapons and Trade Skills
              as you like, your Core Attributes ultimately govern a large part of how powerful you are relative to the
              various hostile creatures and other players in Aeternum.

              When you first arrive in Aeternum, your Character will have 5 points in each of the core attributes and
              you cannot drop below that 5-point minimum. Each time your Character levels up, you are granted Attribute
              Points to spend on whichever Attribute(s) you choose. Gains from Attributes are soft-capped at 195 points.
              You can go beyond the soft cap with the help of armor, weapons, and trinkets, but there are diminishing
              returns starting at 100 points. If you feel you’ve placed a point in error or you want to switch up your
              total point allocation, you can redistribute (respec) your attributes for a small fee. The cost to respec
              increases as you increase in level, however, so keep that in mind!

              Using a weapon in combat against creatures results in gaining XP for that weapon’s Mastery when those
              creatures are defeated. Every weapon in the game can be mastered. Each Weapon Mastery has 2 Skill Trees,
              and each Skill Tree has a selection of active abilities, passive modifiers, and bonuses that are exclusive
              to that weapon. Leveling your Weapon Mastery grants a point that can be spent to unlock one of these
              abilities, passives, or bonuses. However, it is not possible to unlock everything between both Mastery
              Trees, so you’ll have to choose wisely. If you want to try out a different build for a weapon, you can
              respec its Mastery Trees in exchange for some Azoth. We will dive deeper into Weapon Mastery in the
              future. However you choose to fight, you’ll need to forge and discover powerful weapons to fit your
              combat style. Whether battling in wars with other players or holding back waves of The Corrupted, your
              combat skills will mean the difference between life and death.
